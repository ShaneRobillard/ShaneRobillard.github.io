                </figure> 
                <strong>Shrimp</strong>: As stated above, everything in the water loves shrimp, making it one of the best if not best baits to use. They can be used in both freshwater and saltwater to catch a variety of fish. They are best used fresh instead of frozen. You can find them at most bait shops as well catching them fresh yourself.
              </div>
              <div id="tabs-2">

                </figure> 
                <strong>Sand Fleas</strong>: One of the best things about this bait is you can catch them yourself fresh. They are plentiful on the beach during anytime of the day. They are naturally already a part of most fish's diet. This makes them a tempting target while fishing. With its hard shell, it is easy to hook as well.

              <div id="tabs-3">

                </figure> 
                <strong>Clams</strong>: This bait is best used alive. They are usually closed completely when found fresh and alive. Also, the fresher it is, the easier it is to hook and keep hooked. It is best to find a store for this as it is not cost friendly to find them on your own. They have a unique smell that makes them alluring to fish.

                </figure> 
                <strong>Crabs</strong>: Crabs take some preparation for use as bait. They can be found fresh using crab traps, or from bait shops all along the coast. They are quite useful when prepared properly as they can survive harsh conditions when casting and reeling. There are dozens of species and they are quite delicious for fish of all sizes.

                </figure> 
                <strong>Squid</strong>: You can use squid whole or cut them into strips. Squid comes in a variety of sizes and can be found in bait shops and even supermarkets. With squid it doesn't have to be fresh, allowing for storage of the bait for later. It is one of the best all-around baits to have for fishing as it can be used to catch a wide variety of fish.

                </figure> 
                <strong>Cut Bait</strong>: This is useful in the fact that you can reuse the small fish you caught as bait. You can turn the small fish into large fish as easy as hooking and casting. All varieties of fish can easily be cut up and reused to catch the fish you actually want.
