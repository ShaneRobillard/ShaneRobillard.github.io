            <ul>
                <li>Shrimp: As stated above, everything in the water loves shrimp making it one of the best if not best baits to use. They best used fresh instead of frozen.</li>
                <li>Sand Fleas: One of the best things about this bait is you can catch them yourself fresh. They are plentiful on the beach during anytime of the day.</li>
                <li>Clams: This bait is best used alive. They are usually closed completely when found alive. It is best to find a store for this as it is not cost friendly to find them on your own.</li>
                <li>Crabs: Crabs take some preparation for use as bait. They are quite useful when prepared properly as they can survive harsh conditions. Fish love them.</li>
                <li>Cut Bait: This is useful in the fact that you can reuse the small fish you caught as bait. You can turn the small fish into large fish.</li>
