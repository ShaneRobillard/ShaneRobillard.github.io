      <h3>Peer Review #1 - Emily Gustafson</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The page is consistent and well thought-out.</li>
        <li>Contrast: The contrast of the webpages is well done. The color choices are great and they work well with each other.</li>
        <li>Repetition: The overall design of the webpage repeats as necessary without being too repetitive.</li>
        <li>Alignment: The only problem I see with alignment is the thumbnails of the images on the pictures tab. They are left-aligned instead of aligned to the center. Other than that, everything is great.</li>
        <li>Proximity: Use of proximity is well done. Everything appears to be where it needs to be in relation to each other.</li>
        <li>Good use of interactivity with the slideshow and the contact us form.</li>
        <li>Overall, this website looks amazing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peer Review #2 - Mike Bucala</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The pages are somewhat consistent.</li>
        <li>Contrast: The contrasts of the pages is well done. The only problem I see here is that the black color was used instead of near-black per instructions.</li>
        <li>Repetition: The webpage manaages to repeat without being too repetitive.</li>
        <li>Alignment: The only problem I see with alignment is the images on the homepage seeming to be centered on the left side of the page. Other than that, alignment is good to go.</li>
        <li>Proximity: Proximity is done well. Everything appears to be where it should be.</li>
        <li>interactivity is well done, only problem I see here is the use of the exact same slideshows on the cups/tshirts pages with different pictures.</li>
        <li>Overall, this website look great.</li>
