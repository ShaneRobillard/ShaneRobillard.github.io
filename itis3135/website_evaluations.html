        <a href="https://www.simplychocolate.com/">Simply Chocolate</a>
        </h3>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: The white background with the dark pictures makes for a standout setup. The majority brown is reminiscent of the chocolate they sell and works well with the white and black.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition:  The font and size of the text is repeated throughout. The pictures are all of a consistent size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: The interactive pictures are all centered into the middle of the page. The top menu is also centered into the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: The menu options are all close to each other at the top. The pictures are all close together in the center.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
        <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale Art School</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Art School of Yale has a website that is a collaboration between the students and the professors. This means the website is designed by dozens of people.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: This website is all over the place with colors making it hard to read some of the writing. The sizes are also all over the place making it hard to even attempt to contrast anything.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition: There is no repetition except for the fact that it has writing on the page. There is no consistency at all with the fonts, colors or even the design.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: Everything is shoved into the left side of the page. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the placement of any of the elements of the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: They have everything shoved together. It is hard to tell what is related to what and whether or not its even supposed to be there.
            </li>
